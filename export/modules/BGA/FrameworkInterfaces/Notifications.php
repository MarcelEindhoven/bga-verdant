 * Notifications are sent at the very end of the user request, when it ends normally.
 * It means that if you throw an exception for any reason (ex: move not allowed), no notifications will be sent to players.
 * Notifications sent between the game start (setupNewGame) and the end of the "action" method of the first active state will never reach their destination.
